    <p class="mb-4">This is a very important PSA for whomever takes the time to read it:</p>
    <p class="mb-4">The em dash (—) is a punctuation mark that is longer than a hyphen. It is commonly used in place of a comma or colon to create a stronger break in a sentence.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">For example, instead of writing "I have a dog, and her name is June," you could write "I have a dog — her name is June."</p>
    <p class="mb-4">The em dash has been around for quite a while and IT DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY MEAN SOMETHING IS AI GENERATED.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I feel like I've done my part to advocate for those of us who have a longstanding realtionship with our old friend, Em. Thanks for taking time out of your day to read about something that's dear to my heart.</p>
